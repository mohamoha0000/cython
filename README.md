<h2>enc.py :</h2>
<b>It's native Cython, meaning a file is converted directly into Cython with all the functions and everything</b>

<h2>enc2.py :</h2>
<b>It is a cython that is not converted directly. This means that before converting to cython, it is encrypted using Base64. After that, the cipher text is divided into pieces to make it difficult for a hacker to compile the code again.
The reason for using this method is that Cyton fails to convert some times due to strange formatting of text and symbols</b>
